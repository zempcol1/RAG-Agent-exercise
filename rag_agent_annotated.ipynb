T2D is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease [ 2], kidney \\ndisease [ 3, 4], amputation [ 5–7], certain cancers [ 8], and blindness [ 9, 10], which results in \\na major cost burden to the healthcare system [ 1]. The primary risk factor for T2D is obesity, \\nwith the majority of those with T2D having overweight or obesity [ 11, 12]. Obesity also \\nincreases the risk of several other co-morbid conditions including heart disease and stroke \\n[11, 13, 14]. It has been demonstrated that both T2D and obesity can be treated with lifestyle \\nmodification. For example, in DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) weight loss of \\n10 to 15 kg resulted in the remission of T2D in a majority of individuals who had been \\nwho had been diagnosed with T2D within the past 6 years. Nearly 9 in 10 of individuals \\nachieving more than 15 kg of weight loss remitted their T2D [ 15]. While it is clear that \\nweight loss is associated with improvements in T2D, the role of diet composition in the \\nreversal of T2D presents a gap in knowledge.\\nHigher protein diets are an attractive target for lifestyle-based interventions for the treatment \\nof T2D. High protein diets, especially when combined with exercise, produce greater weight \\nloss and prevent losses of fat free mass (FFM) compared to lower protein diets [ 16–18]. In \\npremenopausal women with obesity without diabetes, a high protein diet improved insulin \\nsensitivity more than a high carbohydrate diet even though achieved weight loss was not \\ndifferent between diets (high protein: 9.8 ± 1.4%, high carbohydrate: 9.3 ± 1.6%, p = \\n0.9323) [ 19]. Conversely, a study in post-menopausal women found that consuming a high \\nprotein diet during weight loss eliminated the beneficial effects of 10% weight loss on \\ninsulin action and sensitivity [ 20]. These conflicting results suggest that additional studies \\non the amount and sources of dietary protein during weight loss are needed to determine its \\ninfluence on weight loss induced improvements in T2D.\\nRed meats –and beef in particular –are important contributors to dietary protein intakes \\nin the United States [ 21]. However, some observational studies have associated red \\nmeat consumption with higher risk of T2D, leading to recommendations to limit its \\nconsumption [ 22, 23]. Recommendations to limit red meat consumption are based mostly \\non observational data, while findings from randomized clinical trials usually find a neutral \\neffect of red meat consumption on health outcomes [ 24–28]. A recent meta-analysis found \\nno differences in most glycemic and insulinemic risk factors associated with T2D when \\ncomparing reduced or no red meat diets to diets that contained red meat [ 29]. However, \\nthe impact on red meat consumption during weight loss among people with T2D remains \\nambiguous. Thus, it would be important to know whether beef can be part of a HP dietary \\nplan to reverse T2D by contributing to weight and fat loss and improving weight loss \\nmaintenance.Clina et al. Page 2\\nObesity (Silver Spring) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 August 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to compare a high protein diet (HP) versus \\na normal protein diet (NP) for weight loss, body composition changes, and indicators of type \\n2 diabetes status during a 52-week behavioral weight loss intervention. Both intervention \\ndiets were energy-restricted, and the HP diet included recommendations to include lean \\nbeef in the diet whereas the NP was instructed to refrain from eating any red meats for the \\nduration of the stud. The hypotheses were the HP diet would lead to greater weight loss, \\npreferential loss of fat mass compared to fat free mass, and greater improvements glucose \\ncontrol and cardiometabolic health.\\nMethods\\nParticipants\\nOne hundred and six individuals (80 female) began the intervention and were recruited \\nfrom the Denver, CO (n=39) and Birmingham, AL (n=67) metropolitan areas using letters, \\ninternet advertisements, and news advertisements to participate in the trial. A diagram \\ndepicting participant flow is presented in Figure 1. The study was conducted in three \\ncohorts, with approximately 35 participants in each cohort. Cohort 1 was from the Denver, \\nCO area and began the intervention in January 2020. Cohorts 2 and 3 were from the \\nBirmingham, AL area and began in February 2020 and April 2021, respectively. Participants \\nwere required to be at least 18 years old, BMI ≥27 kg/m2, T2D diagnosis within the past 6 \\nyears (documented physician diagnosis, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dl, or HbA1c ≥6.5%), be \\nweight stable (±3 kg in the past 3 months), and be stable on all medications for the past 3 \\nmonths. Regarding eligibility criteria for T2D diagnosis, participants were enrolled who had \\na recent diagnosis as described above without meeting the threshold for fasting glucose or \\nHbA1c if that participant was on medication to manage their T2D, which would lower these \\nvalues. Exclusion criteria were: HbA1c ≥ 12%, current eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia), \\ndependence on illicit drugs or alcohol, untreated hypothyroidism, currently using insulin or \\nother drugs known to cause weight loss or gain (including GLP-1 of SGLT-2 medications, \\nsteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, chemotherapy, antipsychotics, prescribed or OTC weight \\nloss agent), following a vegetarian or vegan diet, any illness or injury that would make it \\nunsafe to follow a diet and/or exercise up to 70 minutes at a moderate intensity regularly, \\nand women who were pregnant, lactating, trying to become pregnant, or who had been \\npregnant or lactating in the last six months. Criteria for diabetes diagnoses were confirmed \\nthrough medical records or doctor reports, blood biomarkers were confirmed via a blood \\ntest at the screening visit, and all other criteria were confirmed by self-report. The study \\nprotocol was reviewed and approved the Institutional Review Boards at the University of \\nAlabama at Birmingham and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. The study \\nwas registered on clinicaltrials.gov  as NCT03832933 .\\nExperimental Design\\nAll participants followed the State of Slim (SOS) weight management program for the first \\n16 weeks of the program, which consisted of weekly group classes led by a trained coach. \\nParticipants received copies of the SOS book, copies of the course materials, and access \\nto the online community. After the first 16 weeks, participants participated in the SOS \\nNext Steps program which consists of 18 bi-weekly group classes for the remainder of the Clina et al. Page 3\\nObesity (Silver Spring) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 August 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptintervention. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups: the high protein \\ngroup (HP) with instructions to consume ≥4 weekly servings of lean beef as the only source \\nof red meat or a normal protein group (NP) with instructions to not eat red meat for the \\nduration of the study and followed a modified SOS diet that reduced protein intake.\\nDiet Intervention\\nThe SOS plan is broken up into three distinct phases, each of which having food lists for \\nparticipants to choose from as well as defined portion sizes for each food. Typically, the \\nSOS plan is a high-protein, low fat diet plan that emphasizes non starchy and whole-grain \\ncarbohydrates. The SOS plan also has five diet rules that are to be followed throughout \\neach phase: (1) Eat five to six times per day. (2) Eat breakfast within 1 hour of waking. \\n(3) Do not count calories; instead, measure portions. (4) Have the right protein mix at each \\nmeal (one carbohydrate and one protein at each meal). (5) Eat a healthy fat twice a day. \\nFood lists for the HP and NP groups were similar, with the exception of the HP group \\nbeing asked to consume lean beef ≥4 times per week and the portion sizes for the protein \\nbeing reduced for the NP group. Approximate carbohydrate and protein compositions were \\n32% and 40% of total energy for the HP diet, respectively and 53% and 21% for the NP \\ndiet, respectively. Recommended fat intakes were similar for HP (28% of total energy) \\nand NP (26%). Food lists for each phase given to participants with adjusted portion sizes \\nare presented in supplemental tables 1, 2, and 3. In addition, participants worked up to \\nexercising up to 70 minutes per day, 6 days per week as a part of the program.\\nSelf-reported energy intake and macronutrient distribution were not tracked during the study \\nbecause a principal component of the SOS program is to focus on portion sizes as opposed \\nto counting calories (Diet Rule #3). Participants did complete food logs throughout the \\nintervention, however these were used as a self-monitoring tool to enhance weight loss [ 30], \\nand not intended to measure energy intake or macronutrient distribution. Per the diet rules, \\na detailed food log designed to capture these data would be inconsistent with the program \\ngoals and structure. Further, self-reported measured of food intake are unreliable, and their \\nsuitability for clinical research has been questioned [ 31].\\nParticipants were instructed that clinical decision making as regards T2D management was \\nto be made with their primary care provider, but participants were asked to report any \\nmedication changes to research staff as soon as feasible. Study staff also queried participants \\non any medication changes on a monthly basis throughout the study period.\\nProtocol Modifications due to COVID-19\\nThe original plan for this intervention was for SOS classes to be held in-person. The onset \\nof lockdown orders in the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic required that \\nclasses be moved to an online platform (Zoom). The online intervention format was used \\nfor the remainder of the trial. The group classes were switched to the online format for \\ncohort 1 (Colorado) at week 7 of the intervention and at week 4 for cohort 2 (Alabama). The \\nintervention for cohort 3 (Alabama) was conducted entirely online. Weekly self-weighing \\nwas completed at home with pictures of scale weight sent to the health coaches in lieu \\nof weighing in-person before each class. Additionally, the Week 16 study visits became Clina et al. Page 4\\nObesity (Silver Spring) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 August 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptat-home study visits for cohorts 1 and 2 with limited data collection due to university-wide \\nrestrictions on in-person clinical research at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical \\nCampus and the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Participants were sent a link to \\na video call with research staff, who conducted the visit. For this manuscript, baseline \\nand week 52 data were used to assess study outcomes due to the limited data collection \\ntechniques used during the week 16 visits.\\nAnthropometric Measurements\\nBody weight was measured at baseline and week 52 using a digital platform scale \\n(Colorado: Tanita BWB-800 Digital scale, Tanita Cooperation of America, Inc., Arlington \\nHeights, Illinois; Alabama: DETECTO BRW1000, DETECTO, Webb City, MO) in a fasted \\nstate in clinic with participants wearing light clothing after voiding. Height was measured \\nusing a stadiometer in clinic at the screening visit. Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m2) was \\ncalculated using these measurements. Body composition (fat and lean mass) was measured \\nusing dual x ‐ray absorptiometry at baseline and week 52 (Colorado: Horizon W, APEX \\nsoftware version 5.6.05 Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA; Alabama GE Lunar Prodigy \\nPrimo, enCORE software version 15.10.046, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Waist \\ncircumference (WC) was measured at the border of the iliac crest in duplicate in accordance \\nwith the National Institutes of Health recommendations [ 32], measured at baseline and week \\n52.\\nCardiometabolic Health\\nBlood samples were obtained at baseline and week 52 from an antecubital vein by a \\ntrained phlebotomist. Samples were processed and analyzed for glucose, total cholesterol, \\nlow‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL; calculated), high ‐density lipoprotein cholesterol \\n(HDL), triglycerides, HbA1c, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Blood samples were \\nprocessed at the University of Alabama Outreach Lab for Alabama samples and at \\nUniversity of Colorado Hospital Clinical Lab for screening and at the Adult CTRC Core lab \\nfor baseline and week 52 visits for Colorado samples. Blood pressure was measured at each \\nin-person study visit using at the left upper arm using an automatic sphygmomanometer \\n(Colorado: Datascope Trio, (Serial# MC07547-A5) Digital Patient Monitor; Alabama, \\nOmron 3-Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor, OMRON Healthcare Inc., Kyoto, \\nJapan). Blood pressure was measured after the participant rested quietly in a seated position \\nfor ≥5 min with participants’ legs uncrossed and back and arms supported. The measurement \\nwas taken two times and if the reading differed by more than 5 mmHg, a third measurement \\nwas obtained.\\nStatistical Analyses\\nAll study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools \\nhosted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Colorado Denver [ 33, \\n34]. REDCap is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture \\nfor research studies, providing (1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; (2) audit \\ntrails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated export procedures \\nfor seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and (4) procedures for data Clina et al.

All analyses were completed using \\nSAS (version 9.4, 2002–2012 by SAS Institute Inc.).\\nA sample size of 120 participants was targeted based on findings from the Beef WISE \\nStudy [ 25] to detect a 2.75 kg difference in weight loss between the HP and NP. Weight \\nloss achieved by the ‘Beef’ group in the Beef WISE Study was 8.9±6.0 kg, and this \\ngroup received the same dietary plan and counseling as the HP group in the current \\nstudy. Assuming a similar amount and variability in achieved weight loss, statistical power \\ncalculations indicated that sample size of 112 (56 per group) would provide >80% power ( α \\n= 0.05) to detect a 2.75 kg difference in weight loss.\\nBaseline characteristics were assessed by diet group (HP and NP) as well as the total of \\nthe whole sample. Randomization was performed by the statistician and was stratified by \\nage, sex, BMI, and years since diagnosis of T2D. Differences in baseline characteristic \\nwere assessed using paired t-tests or Chi-squared tests. Linear mixed models (LMM) with \\nunstructured covariance were used to test the effect of diet group, time, and their interaction \\nterm for changes in body weight and composition, and cardiometabolic health using and \\nintention to treat approach (ITT), meaning that all participants that were randomized and \\nhave one or more measures were included in LMM analyses regardless of completion of \\nprotocol or adherence. Differences in frequency of reducing or discontinuing medication for \\nT2D was assessed using Chi-squared tests. SAS 9.4 was used for all the analyses. P<0.05 is \\ndeemed statistically significant.\\nResults\\nBaseline Characteristics of Participants\\nBaseline characteristic of participants are presented in Table 1. No differences in any \\nbaseline characteristics were detected between HP and NP. Participant retention at 52 weeks \\ndid not differ between HP and NP (completed: HP n=37 (69.8%); NP n=34 (64.2%), p= \\n0.51).\\nAdverse Events\\nNo adverse events likely to be related to the study were reported by participants in either \\ngroup.\\nWeight Loss and Body Composition\\nChanges in body weight and composition are shown in Figure 2. Total mass was reduced by \\n10.2±1.6 kg (9.4%) in the HP group and 12.7±4.8 kg (11.8%) in the NP group (Figure 2), \\nwith no difference between groups ( p=0.336). Fat mass percent decreased (HP, 46.2±0.8% \\nvs. 41.9±1.1%, p<0.001; NP, 46.6±0.8% vs. 42.8±1.6%, p<0.001) and fat free mass percent \\nincreased (HP, 52.9±0.8% vs. 57.1±1.1%, p<0.001; NP, 51.8±1.6%, vs. 55.4±0.8% p<0.001) \\nin both groups during the intervention period with no significant difference between HP and \\nNP (fat mass percent, p = 0.665; fat free mass percent, p = 0.689). Both the HP and NP \\ngroups reduced waist circumference (HP, 118±2.0 cm vs. 111±2.1 cm, p=<0.001; NP, 117±2 \\ncm vs. 109±2 cm, p=<0.001) and BMI (HP, 38.7±1.0 kg/m2 vs. 35.0±1.0 kg/m2, p=<0.001; Clina et al.

Supplemental \\nfigure 1 includes additional plots related to body composition changes by group.\\nIndicators of Type 2 Diabetes\\nChanges in indicators of type 2 diabetes are presented in Table 2. In general, participants \\nreduced HbA1c, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR with no differences in changes between HP \\nand NP. Data describing participants with HbA1c ≥6.5% or fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL \\n(clinically diagnostic of T2D) at baseline and week 52 by diet group are presented in Table \\n3. At baseline, 73.6% of participants in the HP group and 62.3% of participants in the NP \\ngroup had biomarkers in the range for T2D. Using the ITT approach, 24.5% and 22.6% \\nof participants in the HP and NP groups respectively reduced these values to no longer \\nmeet diagnostic criteria for T2D. Using the completer analyses, these numbers are 38.2% \\nand 38.5% for the HP and NP groups respectively. Four participants in the HP group and \\n1 participant in the NP group were classified as having a negative change, with values at \\nbaseline not meeting criteria for T2D diagnosis, but meeting these criteria at week 52. There \\nwere no differences between diet groups for any changes in T2D indicators. Also during \\nthe trial, n=14 participants (HP, n=5; NP, n=9) discontinued all T2D medications and n=16 \\n(HP, n=7; NP, n=9) reduced at least one T2D medication. The frequency of discontinuing or \\nreducing T2D medications was not statistically different between HP and NP ( p=0.4358).\\nLaboratory Markers\\nChanges in blood pressure, lipids, and BUN are summarized in Table 4. Participants reduced \\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures, and triglycerides with no differences between groups. \\nBUN was increased in both groups at week 52 compared to baseline with no difference \\nbetween HP and NP. There were no changes in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or LDL \\ncholesterol in either group over the duration of the intervention.\\nDiscussion\\nBoth the HP and NP diet groups significantly reduced weight and improved in key indicators \\nof T2D with no difference between groups. These findings support data suggesting that \\nweight loss is the primary driver of improvements in glucose control. Results from the Look \\nAHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study found that those with a 5–10% reduction \\nin weight had increased odds of achieving a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c (odds ratio 3.52) \\n[35]. Evidence from review papers also suggests that modest weight loss can successfully \\nresult in remission of T2D in many individuals [ 36]. Findings from the current study further \\nsupport the notion that weight loss can produce improvements in glucose control in many \\nwith T2D. Average weight loss in the current study was consistent with that found to cause \\nimprovements in T2D in the majority of participants in DiRECT [ 15]. Our results extend \\nthose of previous research by demonstrating that weight loss is an effective treatment for \\nT2D.\\nContrary to the hypothesis, the HP diet did not result in greater weight loss when compared \\nto the NP diet. Instead, the groups had similar weight loss and body composition changes Clina et al. Page 7\\nObesity (Silver Spring) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 August 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptfollowing the intervention. It was also hypothesized that the HP group would result in \\npreferential loss of fat mass compared to fat free mass which was also not supported. A \\nrecent review suggested that a weight loss could increase risk of mortality for those recently \\ndiagnosed with T2D potentially as a result in a decline in appendicular lean mass [ 37]. \\nWhile appendicular body composition was not analyzed for the present study, whole-body \\nfat free mass was only slightly reduced with no significant differences between groups. The \\npreferential loss of fat mass in both diet groups in the present study lessens concerns related \\nto potential weight loss-related adverse events.\\nResults from this study also add to the literature regarding the impact of HP diets during \\nweight loss for individuals with T2D. The HP and NP groups had similar reduction in \\nindices of T2D, including HbA1c and fasting glucose. Some trials have demonstrated that \\na HP diet is more beneficial than a high carbohydrate diet in outcomes associated with \\nT2D [ 19, 38]. However, One trial in post-menopausal women demonstrated that a HP diet \\nduring weight loss could negatively insulin action [ 20], however this did not seem to be \\nthe case in the present study, as marked by similar improvements in HOMA-IR across \\ngroups. In the present study, at baseline, 73.6% of participants in the HP group and 62.3% \\nof participants in the NP group had biomarkers in the range for T2D. Notably, inclusion \\ninto the study was based on previously diagnosed T2D but did not require participants to \\npresent with a diagnostic value for A1c or fasting glucose at baseline. This resulted in some \\nparticipants having A1c or fasting glucose below the diabetic range at study entry. This is \\nlikely because many participants were taking T2D medications at baseline and they were \\nnot required to discontinue medications at study entry as has been done in other studies \\nsuch as DiRECT [ 15]. Participants exhibiting indices of T2D was reduced to 35.1% and \\n32.4% in the HP and NP groups, respectively. These findings strongly suggest that achieved \\nweight loss – regardless of dietary pattern – is the primary factor driving improvements \\nin glucose control. This finding has substantial public health implications as it provides a \\ndegree of individual-level flexibility in choosing a dietary pattern that is consistent with \\npatient preferences.\\nThese results demonstrate that the inclusion of lean, minimally processed beef does not \\nimpact the effectiveness of an energy restricted diet to induce weight loss and improvements \\nin cardiometabolic health. Previous work from our group found equivalent changes in body \\nweight and composition between a HP diet including beef and a HP diet excluding all red \\nmeat [ 25]. The present study builds on this work, through the investigation of two diets \\nwith differing recommended macronutrient compositions. From these data, it is evident that \\nminimally processed, lean beef can be safely included in diets when attempting to lose \\nweight and control glucose.\\nA limitation of this trial was that despite giving explicit diet rules and lists to participants, \\nboth groups saw an equivalent increase in BUN from baseline to week 52. This finding \\ncould indicate that the protein composition of the diet groups likely did not reach the \\nintended macronutrient distributions, with the groups consuming similar amounts of protein. \\nThe study might not have been able to detect the true impact on improvements in T2D \\nmarkers because participants discontinued medication as recommended by their primary \\ncare providers. This could mean that the observed intervention could have had a greater Clina et al. Page 8\\nObesity (Silver Spring) .

Additionally, the COVID-19 \\npandemic began during the first cohort of the AL and CO groups and lasted throughout the \\nrest of the study. The onset of the pandemic resulted in several methodological changes of \\nthe study and impacted the lives of participants taking part in the intervention. Fortunately, \\nthe SOS program had been previously delivered in a virtual format, so changes to course \\ncontent were minor. Classes were still able to be held at the usual time, but in a virtual \\nsetting. However, research study visits were completely halted for a period during the study, \\nhence the completion of some of the week 16 visits virtually instead of in-person. This \\nchange limited the data that could be collected at this timepoint. In addition, some outcome \\nmeasures tests that were originally collected in person could no longer be collected at all, \\neven when restrictions were lifted, including resting energy expenditure and six-minute walk \\ntest. These two tests were removed because masks were still required in the research facility \\nand since baseline measurements were collected without masks, it was unclear if the use of \\nmasks at future visits would impact results. Some participants who withdrew from the study \\ncited COVID-19 as a primary reason for leaving, such as increased work demands. Total \\nattrition overall was high at 33%, which is likely due in part to the challenges faced during \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Despite challenges, the study team was able to adapt swiftly to the \\nnature of the pandemic and continue the intervention and data collection.\\nThese result show that behavioral weight loss programs can produce significant weight loss \\nin those with T2D and that this weight loss can improve glucose control and many other \\naspects of cardiometabolic health. Results also show that avoiding red meat does not provide \\nan advantage either in weight loss or in disease management.\\nSupplementary Material\\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors acknowledge Jeanne Anne Breen and Aaron Chestnut for their effort in the recruitment, retention, \\nand completion of study visits.

T2D is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease [ 2], kidney \\ndisease [ 3, 4], amputation [ 5–7], certain cancers [ 8], and blindness [ 9, 10], which results in \\na major cost burden to the healthcare system [ 1]. The primary risk factor for T2D is obesity, \\nwith the majority of those with T2D having overweight or obesity [ 11, 12]. Obesity also \\nincreases the risk of several other co-morbid conditions including heart disease and stroke \\n[11, 13, 14]. It has been demonstrated that both T2D and obesity can be treated with lifestyle \\nmodification. For example, in DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) weight loss of \\n10 to 15 kg resulted in the remission of T2D in a majority of individuals who had been \\nwho had been diagnosed with T2D within the past 6 years. Nearly 9 in 10 of individuals \\nachieving more than 15 kg of weight loss remitted their T2D [ 15].

High protein (HP) diets are commonly used for weight loss, but whether protein \\nsources, especially red meat, impact weight loss-induced T2D management is unknown. This \\ntrial compared a HP diet including red meat and normal protein (NP) without red meat for weight \\nloss, body composition changes, and glucose control in individuals with T2D.\\nMethods:\\xa0 106 adults (80 female) with T2D consumed a HP (40% protein) diet with ≥4 weekly \\nservings of lean beef or a NP (21% protein) diet excluding red meat during a 52-week weight \\nloss intervention. Body weight, body composition, and cardiometabolic parameters were measured \\nbefore and after intervention.\\nResults:\\xa0 Weight loss was not different between HP (−10.2±1.6 kg) and NP (−12.7±4.8 kg,\\n\\nHigher protein diets are an attractive target for lifestyle-based interventions for the treatment \\nof T2D. High protein diets, especially when combined with exercise, produce greater weight \\nloss and prevent losses of fat free mass (FFM) compared to lower protein diets [ 16–18]. In \\npremenopausal women with obesity without diabetes, a high protein diet improved insulin \\nsensitivity more than a high carbohydrate diet even though achieved weight loss was not \\ndifferent between diets (high protein: 9.8 ± 1.4%, high carbohydrate: 9.3 ± 1.6%, p = \\n0.9323) [ 19]. Conversely, a study in post-menopausal women found that consuming a high \\nprotein diet during weight loss eliminated the beneficial effects of 10% weight loss on \\ninsulin action and sensitivity [ 20]. These conflicting results suggest that additional studies \\non the amount and sources of dietary protein during weight loss are needed to determine its \\ninfluence on weight loss induced improvements in T2D.\\nRed meats –and beef in particular –are important contributors to dietary protein intakes \\nin the United States [ 21]. However, some observational studies have associated red \\nmeat consumption with higher risk of T2D, leading to recommendations to limit its \\nconsumption [ 22, 23]. Recommendations to limit red meat consumption are based mostly \\non observational data, while findings from randomized clinical trials usually find a neutral \\neffect of red meat consumption on health outcomes [ 24–28]. A recent meta-analysis found \\nno differences in most glycemic and insulinemic risk factors associated with T2D when \\ncomparing reduced or no red meat diets to diets that contained red meat [ 29]. However, \\nthe impact on red meat consumption during weight loss among people with T2D remains\\n\\ncomparing reduced or no red meat diets to diets that contained red meat [ 29]. However, \\nthe impact on red meat consumption during weight loss among people with T2D remains \\nambiguous. Thus, it would be important to know whether beef can be part of a HP dietary \\nplan to reverse T2D by contributing to weight and fat loss and improving weight loss \\nmaintenance.Clina et al.

Both intervention \\ndiets were energy-restricted, and the HP diet included recommendations to include lean \\nbeef in the diet whereas the NP was instructed to refrain from eating any red meats for the \\nduration of the stud.
